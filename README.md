# 🚗 Co2_Emission_Prediction using Random Forest Regression

## 🌍 Overview
This project is an **interactive CO₂ Emission Prediction App** built using **Streamlit** and **Random Forest Regression**. It allows users to input vehicle details and instantly predicts the CO₂ emissions based on their inputs. The model is trained on real-world vehicle data to provide accurate predictions.

## ✨ Features
✅ **User-friendly interactive web interface** with real-time updates  
✅ **Predicts CO₂ emissions (g/km)** based on key vehicle parameters  
✅ **Visualizes input features** for better understanding  
✅ **Uses a trained Random Forest Regressor model** for accurate predictions  
✅ **Deployed on Streamlit Cloud for instant access**  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- 🐍 **Python** (Main programming language)
- 🎨 **Streamlit** (Web app framework)
- 🤖 **scikit-learn** (Machine learning model)
- 📊 **pandas, numpy** (Data handling)
- 🔄 **Git & GitHub** (Version control)

## 📂 Dataset & Model
The dataset includes **5 key vehicle features**:
- 🏎️ **Engine Size (L)**
- 🔄 **Cylinders**
- ⛽ **Fuel Consumption (City, Highway, Combined)**

The model is a **Random Forest Regressor**, trained and saved as `co2_rf_model.pkl`.
